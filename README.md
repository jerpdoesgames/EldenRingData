# EldenRingData
Elden Ring armament, spell, etc. data in machine-readable format for public use.
---
This is a repository of common information such as weapon damage & scaling values, spell information & FP costs, etc. that can be used in websites, tools such as build planners, etc.

Why machine-readable? - So it can easily be filtered/processed or reformatted in whatever manner is needed.
